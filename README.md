# Friday-Night-Funkin-Bot
It's a bot that automatically plays fnf without any extra libraries! Works on 1440p monitors only, but that will change soon.
# Use
To use the application, make sure you have a normal install of FNF, with any mods that do not alter the color of the arrows, or the location of them.
Make sure you have a 1440p monitor, or have a monitor larger that is set to 1440p in windows settings. Future support of non-1440p monitors will come, but currently that's the best I have.
# Installation
All you have to do is go to the most recent release of the application and download the .exe file that is there, and make sure you have the c++ visual redistributable 2015 downloaded
(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
and just open the application from there. Make sure the game is in full view, but not full screen, so you can see the top application bar and taskbar, but it's otherwise full screen.
# Issues
It sometimes misses notes, which is just because it does it real time, and isn't precalculated.
Monitor view only works in 1440p.
